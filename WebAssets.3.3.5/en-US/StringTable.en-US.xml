  <Entry key="GUI_STEAM_LINK_HELP_TEXT"><![CDATA[<color=#FFC300><size=120%>]]>How does Steam linking work?<![CDATA[<size=100%></color>]]>

Steam Linking allows you to link your Town of Salem (Tos) account to your Steam account. Once this is done, you can sign in using the Login with Steam button and not have to enter a username or password again.

It is possible to have multiple Steam accounts and to have multiple Town of Salem (ToS) accounts. However, you can only ever link ONE ToS account to a particular Steam account because the relationship between a ToS account and a Steam account is 1 to 1.

However, if you have an alternate Town of Salem account that is NOT restricted* or is a Premium† account, you can choose to sign in with the username and password for that ToS account even though your Steam account is not linked to the ToS account. This allows you to play additional premium or grandfathered ToS accounts via your Steam account.

What you CANNOT do is play a restricted* ToS account via Steam when your Steam account has already been linked to another ToS account. If you attempt to do this, you will be prompted repeatedly if you want to link your ToS account to Steam. If you choose to link, it will fail and you will be prompted again to link your account.

<![CDATA[<color=#FFC300><size=80%>]]>* Restricted - not Premium† and not grandfathered††
† Premium - a ToS account that has purchased Mobile Premium, Web Premium, or Steam
†† Grandfathered - granted free access before Town of Salem moved to Pay-to-Play<![CDATA[<size=100%></color>]]></Entry>

      <align="left"><nobr> </nobr></align>
      <align="left"><indent=5%>The Cauldron Daily Brew is an activity-based reward system that lets you receive shop items for free based on how often you log into the game. The Daily Brew awards daily merit points, with a larger prize awarded on the last day of the seven day brewing period. We've answered a number of questions that you may have about the Cauldron below.</indent></align>
      <align="left"><nobr> </nobr></align>
      <align="left"><b><color=#FFD200>How Does The Cauldron Daily Brew Work?</color></b></align>
      <align="left"><nobr> </nobr></align>
      <align="left"><indent=5%>Every day that you log on to Town of Salem, you can visit the Cauldron by clicking the Daily Brew button in the Home navigation menu. When the Cauldron screen opens, a Witch awaits you behind her cauldron. The Witch gives you a free daily potion that you apply to the Cauldron brew, awarding you 20 Merit Points (or 40 MP for Steam linked or Web Premium accounts). Return each day to apply your free daily potion, and on the seventh day you will win a free random Prize which can include any item from the Shop minus certain exclusive items (such as Refer-a-Friend, SteamBot3000, Kickstarter award items, and Boat Load of Swag).</indent></align>
      <align="left"><nobr> </nobr></align>
      <align="left"><b><color=#FFD200>What Kind of Prizes Can The Cauldron Award?</color></b></align>
      <align="left"><nobr> </nobr></align>
      <align="left"><indent=5%>The Cauldron can award character skins, pets, houses, maps, lobby icons, scrolls, taunts, themes, death animations, and merit points. They are all potential prizes that can be awarded.</indent></align>
      <align="left"><nobr> </nobr></align>
      <align="left"><b><color=#FFD200>Can the Cauldron Award Town Point-Only Items?</color></b></align>
      <align="left"><nobr> </nobr></align>
      <align="left"><indent=5%>Yes, the Cauldon can award Town Point-only items!</indent></align>
      <align="left"><nobr> </nobr></align>
      <align="left"><b><color=#FFD200>Do I Have To Visit the Cauldron Every Day to Retain My Progress?</color></b></align>
      <align="left"><nobr> </nobr></align>
      <align="left"><indent=5%>You do not have to visit every day. You will NOT lose your progress if you miss a day or multiple days. However, the days you do not apply your free daily potion will not count towards completing your seven day brew. Only the days that you visit the Cauldron and apply your potion count towards the completion of the seven day brew.</indent></align>
      <align="left"><nobr> </nobr></align>
      <align="left"><b><color=#FFD200>How Often Can I Visit The Cauldron?</color></b></align>
      <align="left"><nobr> </nobr></align>
      <align="left"><indent=5%>The Cauldron has a 23 hour cooldown between free daily potions. The Daily Brew button at the top of the screen shows how much time remains before the next daily potion can be claimed.</indent></align>
      <align="left"><nobr> </nobr></align>
      <align="left"><b><color=#FFD200>Can I Specialize My Brew to Guarantee I Receive a Certain Type of Prize?</color></b></align>
      <align="left"><nobr> </nobr></align>
      <align="left"><indent=5%>Yes. If you choose to, you can specialize your brew by purchasing a potion using Town Points. The special potion enhances your Cauldron to ensure you receive a certain kind of prize on the seventh day. These specialization potions are optional. The specialization potions available are listed below.</indent></align>
      <align="left"><nobr> </nobr></align>
      <align="left"><indent=5%><b><color=#FFB84D>Character potion</color></b> - guarantees your prize will be a Character skin.</indent></align>

      <align="left"><indent=5%><b><color=#FFB84D>Legendary Potion</color></b> - guarantees you a high value item from the shop (above 2,000TP) such as Uriel, Beelzebub, or Map Pack bundles! If you're awarded a bundle, the Cauldron will spew out multiple prizes!</indent></align>
      <align="left"><nobr> </nobr></align>
      <align="left"><b><color=#FFD200>Does the Default Brew Contain Every Prize Available With the Specialization Potions?</color></b></align>
      <align="left"><nobr> </nobr></align>
      <align="left"><indent=5%>Yes, every item that is available via the specialization potions can also be received via the default brew, just with a lesser chance since the pool of available prizes is larger.</indent></align>
      <align="left"><nobr> </nobr></align>
      <align="left"><b><color=#FFD200>Will The Cauldron Award Me a Prize That I Already Own?</color></b></align>
      <align="left"><nobr> </nobr></align>
      <align="left"><indent=5%>The Cauldron will not award items that you already own except for consumables such as scrolls and taunts.</indent></align>
      <align="left"><nobr> </nobr></align>
      <align="left"><b><color=#FFD200>What If I Already Own All The Items in a Category?</color></b></align>
      <align="left"><nobr> </nobr></align>
      <align="left"><indent=5%>If you already own all items in a category (ex: death animations) then the Cauldron will not let you purchase the specialization potion for that item. If you buy a specialization potion, then subsequently purchase all the items in that category from the shop while the Cauldron is still brewing, then the Cauldron will award you an alternate prize.</indent></align>

  <Entry key="GUI_STORY"><![CDATA[<line-indent=5%><align="left">A harsh winter befell the town, covering it in a thin coating of powdery snow. A frigid, chilling wind whipped through, carrying with it an eerie green smoke containing a deep sickness. Town members were held up in their homes, lethargic, and on the brink of death. The Witch stood over the town frustrated.
“This isn’t how this is supposed to go. This town has taken so much from me, I am supposed to be the one to end it!“ shouted the Witch from the mouth of the Coven’s cave.
Helena approached the Witch. “You will get your revenge. We will make sure of that.”
“Thank you Helena,” said the Witch, turning to address the Coven. “Now, do any of you know who is this being spreading this disease, or what kind of sorcery is being wrought?”
Bakt the Necromancer, Nikki the Potion Master, Helena the Hexmaster, Medusa the Gorgon, and Kande the Poisoner looked around uneasily. No one knew who or what the being was, but it was obviously powerful considering how easily it had plunged the whole town into disease.
“If we are going to battle this being, we need more power on our side,” said the Witch.
A speck of snow landed on the tip of the Witch’s nose, sparking an idea. The Witch rushed into the cave and began rummaging around. Nikki asked, “What are you looking for?”
“Perfect!” said the Witch, pulling out what appeared to be a petrified branch encased in ice. “This is exactly what we need.”
“What is it?” asked Medusa.
“It is an ancient relic as old as Earth, and it will give us all the extra help that we need. One of my past Coven members gave it to me as an incentive to join the Coven. I knew it would be useful one day,” grinned the Witch. “Gather round and channel your energies into the ice with me. We need to melt it and a normal fire will not do.”
Nikki and Kande worked together to prepare a magic-enhancing potion for the others to drink, while the Witch, Helena, Bakt, and Medusa channeled magic into the ice. The Witch's power forced its way into the stone, while Helena’s magic covered the outside of the ice. Bakt’s magic seeped up from the ground and grabbed hold of the ice. Medusa’s magic flowed in a blinding light from the snakes encircling her head. The ice started to shimmer as the Witch cackled. “Keep focusing your magic into the ice!”
As the ice melted, the wind picked up and clouds formed overhead. The snow started to fall faster and heavier, swirling around the witches feet before being carried off by the wind. Before long the witches were at the center of a snowy tornado.
From the corner of her eye, the Witch saw a shadowy figure walking towards them. The figure parted the snow easily and reached for the branch. “Give me that, you cretins. You have no idea what you are doing with it!” The figure snatched the branch, and as he did so, his shadowy shaper resolved before the witches as an old man with pale blue skin and snow white hair, clad in a robe.
“Do you know what you have done! You have disrupted the natural order!” exclaimed the old man.
“We know what this means, but we need your help, Jack,” said the Witch calmly.
Helena gasped. “Jack? Jack Frost?”
“The Spirit of Winter,” the old man confirmed. “Now, you willingly upset the balance of the seasons? By releasing my relic you have swayed the seasons in favor of Winter and upset the other spirits,” scolded Jack.
“Whatever that means, we will deal with it later. We need your help to defeat someone. A being whose powers are unknown to us, and quite powerful,” says the Witch.
“Later? I don’t think you understand the gravity of the situation. In ancient times the seasonal spirits almost tore the world apart fighting over which one of us would be left to rule. When the world--and each of us---were on the brink of death we all agreed to seal away our relics of power and rule together. Now we each take our time to see our perfect vision of the world,” explained Jack.
“We can reseal the relic, but first we need your help. As I said, there is someone we need your help to defeat. Someone more powerful than anyone I have ever seen before. This being carries a lantern that spewed green smoke down onto Salem, causing sickness and disease to spread. I can not allow these people to die by his hands. Those towns members took everything from me, and I will be the one to take everything from them,” the Witch said savagely.
“What? A lantern with green smoke? This can’t be what I think it is,” Jack said worriedly.
The witch's eyes widened. “You know who this is? Tell us so that we can defeat it.”
“If I am not mistaken, this is the work of the Plaguebearer. He is a fell man whose only goal is to spread disease among as many people as possible. This Plaguebearer has lived for as long as I can remember, and is rumored to be something even more terrifying,” trembled Jack. “We need to deal with this, and fast. I will help you, and once this is over, you will return my relic to the ice.”
“If you are this worried, then we should go now,” pressured the Witch.
Jack looked around at the other Coven members, assessing whether their combined might would be enough. With no time to waste, he agreed to join the witches as they set out towards the source of the green smoke.
The group trudged through Salem, looking this way and that. People were stumbling around, lethargic and coughing. Caught up in their own misery, none of the townspeople reacted to them at all. Throughout Salem every soul was infected.
In the distance beyond the town, they could see smoke pouring out of the forest. As the Coven and Jack Frost approachd the edge of the forest, the smoke became heavier, thicker, and more toxic. Bakt began to cough violently, and everyone turned towards her. Bakt's skin was paler than normal, and she appeared a bit sluggish.
“Nikki, Kande, what is wrong with her?” asked the Witch.
“The smoke, it is affecting her. We will take care of this.” Nikki and Kande worked together to create a concoction to help Bakt, and then they continued on their way.
They entered the forest and each member began to feel the effects of the smoke. Nikki distributed the rest of the concoction to the party to help protect them from the effects of the smoke.
From deep in the forest they could hear a horse neighing. The group pushed forward toward the sound of the horse, passing through the trees, and shortly found themselves at a hut. Tied up outside the hut was a pale, sickly horse standing next to a festering trough infested with all manner of insects and algae. From the hut billowed green smoke, and the trees in the area decayed before the group’s eyes.
“Are we ready?” whispered the Witch.
The party glanced around and each other and all nodded. Drawing himself to his full height, Jack summoned forth a winter blast of wind that blew the door to the hut off its hinges. Inside, next to the chimney, sat the Plaguebearer, stoking the fire. The Plaguebearer glanced up at the group briefly, and barely paying them any attention turned back to the fire.
The Witch was puzzled and infuriated by the Plaguebearer’s nonchalant attitude after having his door blown off its hinges.
“Who do you think you are?” shouted the Witch. “Salem is my town to destroy, and I will not let you snatch it out from under me, do you hear me?”
The Plaguebearer continued to stoke the fire, ignoring the angry witch and her group.
“Look at me, you toad!” screeched the Witch, hurling a spell at the Plaguebearer.
The spell smashed into the Plaguebearer, but barely caused his jacket to ruffle. The Plaguebearer stood slowly and turned to the Witch. He stared at her, not saying anything. His gaze pierced through the Witch’s soul like a dagger through the heart.
The Witch stepped back a pace, uneasy and wary of the Plaguebearer. She looked back at the rest of the group and said, “Don’t just stand there! Get him!”
Jack waved his relic towards the door. The ice and snow piled up around the entrance swirled together into a humanoid shape. He waved the ice elemental towards the Plaguebearer while Bakt summoned hands that began to form and reach up from the floors. The elemental reared back to punch the Plaguebearer, but just before the punch landed, the Plaguebearer reached into the elemental's chest and it crumbled to pieces. The hands reaching up from the ground latched onto the legs of the Plaguebearer, holding him in place. Nikki reached into her coat and pulled out a vial that she threw at the Plaguebearer.  It shattered upon his shoulder, releasing a liquid that steamed and bubbled. The Plaguebearer didn't make a sound, but he grabbed his shoulder in pain.
“What is he?” shouted Medusa.
“Just keep attacking!” screamed the Witch as she hurled a ball of light towards the Plaguebearer.
The Plaguebearer was bleeding now, but he didn't appear noticeably concerned. He calmly wiped the blood off with his coat. He picked up his lantern and a flash of green light blinded the group. When their vision returned, they could see that the hands that had been holding the Plaguebearer had dissipated, and he was holding Medusa by the throat as her feet dangled above the ground.
“Medusa!” shouted the Coven.
The Plaguebearer’s eyes darted towards the remainder of the group, then back to Medusa. He tighened his grip on Medusa’s throat. She tried to scream, but the grip on her throat was so tight she could not even manage a squeak.
Jack summoned another icy blast of wind that swept the Plaguebearer off of his feet, causing him to release Medusa. Medusa quickly slithered back to the group, rubbing her raw neck.
As the Plaguebearer stood back up, the Witch noticed that the smoke from his lantern was not as thick as before, and its effects on her seemed to be lessening, although they were all very weak, even Jack, from the smoke and the effort of casting spells.
An idea came to the Witch. It would be all or nothing. “Jack, hold him off for us. I have an idea, it might be just enough for us to win this!” said the Witch. “Everyone else, channel the remainder of your magic into me.”
Jack summoned three more ice elementals to help stall the Plaguebearer. The Plaguebearer slowly stepped forward, challenging Jack. Jack motioned his elementals in and threw a spear of ice towards the Plaguebearer. The Plaguebearer tried to deflect the spear, but it seemed as though his movements were slower than normal, and the spear grazed his side. As the Plaguebearer  looked down to check his wound, one of the elementals caught the side of his face with a punch. The blow staggered the Plaguebearer, but as another elemental reached for him, the Plaguebearer grabbed its face and slammed it into the wall, shattering it.
While the Plaguebearer was distracted by the ice elementals, the Coven members continued to channel their powers into the Witch. The power emanated from her in bright sparks as she began casting a spell.
“Just a little longer, Jack!” the Witch cried.
The Plaguebearer dispatched another elemental with a swift attack to its chest, but stumbled back from the force of the attack. Jack saw the opening and hurled another spear, this time piercing the Plaguebearer's leg. The last elemental rushed forward and landed a kick that sent the Plaguebearer flying into the wall. Another green light flashed in the hut. As the light faded, this time it was Jack that was in trouble. The Plaguebearer had Jack pinned to the ground, and he was beaten and bloodied.
Jack croaked painfully as he looked over at them, “Now is just as good a time as any, witches".
The Plaguebearer looked their way and tried to jump back, but it was too late. The Witch unleashed a powerful blast of magic that blew her back into the wall behind her. When the dust settled there was a gaping hole in the wall where the Plaguebearer had stood.
The Witch stepped up to the hole, peering around for the Plaguebearer. There was a puddle of bloodstained snow where the Plaguebearer had landed after the blast. In the distance, she could see him fleeing atop his horse. The smoke began to clear from the forest as he rode off. The Witch could feel her strength beginning to return.
“I think it is over. I think we won,” sighed the Witch with relief.
When the group returned to their cave, the Witch turned to Jack and thanked him for his help. “We couldn’t have done this without you. I know you didn’t want to get involved.”
“The Plaguebearer seems to be injured, and I doubt he will be coming back anytime soon. Just know that I won’t be coming back to help you again. Prepare for his return, and prepare for the worst when he does,” warned Jack Frost.
The Coven placed their hands on Jack’s staff and began to channel their magic. Jack, using his own magic, blew on the staff with his icy breath, encasing it in ice once again. Then, with a slight smile, he turned to snow and drifted away on the wind.

<b><u>Bug Fixes</u></b>

<b>12/4/2020</b>
Hey Townies, today we are releasing Town of Salem 3.3.3, a minor release focused on QOL tweaks and bug fixes. The most noticeable QOL improvement is that you can now ignore people in Party Chat and in Lobby Chat. The full list for this release is below.

<b><u>Improvements</u></b>
• <indent=3%><b>Party Chat and Lobby Chat:</b> You may now mute/ignore people in the Party Chat and Lobby Chat. If somebody is posting bothersome things, feel the satisfaction of turning them off! If you mute somebody in the Party, that mute will carry over to the Lobby as well. So what happens if the offending person leaves the lobby after you have muted them, and then they return to the lobby to further offend you? Fear not, muting is persistent for the session so when that person returns, they’ll still be muted. Be aware that muting in the Party or Lobby does NOT carry over to the game itself. If the person continues to post offending things once the game starts, you’ll need to re-mute them in game.</indent>
• <indent=3%><b>End Game:</b> Added Lobby Icons to End Game screen players list.</indent>
• <indent=3%><b>Lobby Description:</b> The description for the Serial Killer has been updated to mention their Cautious ability.</indent>
• <indent=3%><b>Chat:</b> Added additional URL types blocked in chat.</indent>
• <indent=3%><b>Burger Menu:</b> Removed link navigation confirmation for non-mobile platforms.</indent>

<b><u>Changes</u></b>
• <indent=3%><b>Passwords:</b> The ampersand symbol (&) has been removed as an acceptable character for new passwords.</indent>

<b><u>Bug Fixes</u></b>
• <indent=3%><b>Game Engine:</b> The game engine has been upgraded to Unity 2019.4.15f1, bringing with it additional underlying bug fixes.</indent>
• <indent=3%><b>Tooltips:</b> Fixed an issue that could cause a tooltip to not disappear when its parent was destroyed.</indent>
• <indent=3%><b>Chat:</b> Added horizontal and vertical tabs to the characters that are stripped from chat messages.</indent>
• <indent=3%>Fixed a null reference exception disconnection that could occur due to a bug in the underlying text controls in Unity.</indent>
• <indent=3%>Fixed a null reference exception disconnection that could occur during the water wheel role reveal.</indent>
• <indent=3%>Fixed a null reference exception that could occur on mobile platforms when showing an ad.</indent>

• <indent=3%><b>Game:</b> The active Game Mode is now shown in the Nameplate in-game.</indent>
• <indent=3%><b>General:</b> Enabled incremental garbage collection on supported platforms (Non-WebGL) which should result in reduced lag due to garbage collection.</indent>
• <indent=3%><b>Game Engine:</b> The Unity game engine has been upgraded to 2019.4.14f1. This brings a slew of underlying bug fixes and enhancements.</indent>

<b><u>Bug Fixes</u></b>

<b>11/17/2020</b>
Hey Townies, today we are releasing our last experimental Ranked role list test for both Ranked and Ranked Practice. After receiving some feedback on our previous changes, we have removed a Random Mafia from the list, replacing it with a Witch and removing the Neutral Evil and replacing it with the Executioner. With these two Neutral Evils, Mafia will have enough allies to be strong, but won't be able to easily coordinate and outnumber the Town early on in the game. We hope to be starting the next Ranked Season soon. Please let us know what you think!

Except for the license expressly granted with the "fan kit," BlankMediaGames reserves all rights, title, and interest in BlankMediaGames Marks and all other intellectual property, and does not authorize you to display or use such in any manner, including but not limited to use on websites, on blogs, in forums, in signatures, on products, or in printed or electronic publications.

B. <u>Game Assets, Town Points and Virtual Items.</u> When using the Game, you may accumulate in-Game assets associated with your Account, including, without limitation, objects, artifacts, currency, items, equipment, and/or other value or status indicators (“Game Assets”) that reside on servers operated by BlankMediaGames as data. You acknowledge and agree that such Game Assets are accumulated as part of your Account and therefore you shall have no ownership or other property interest in any of those Game Assets. You further acknowledge and agree that BlankMediaGames has the right, but not the obligation, to delete, alter, move, remove, or transfer any and all Game Assets, in whole or in part, at any time and for any reason, with or without notice to you, and with no liability of any kind to you. BlankMediaGames does not provide or guarantee, and expressly disclaims any value, cash or otherwise, attributed to any data residing on servers operated by BlankMediaGames, including without limitation the Game Assets associated with your Account.

If you have a valid, active Account, you may participate in our Town Points service offering, which is a redeemable point system that operates like virtual currency (“Town Points”) used to license certain Game Assets that can be used while playing the Game, including, without limitation, character “skins”, backgrounds, in-game houses and pets (“Virtual Items”).

The sale or transfer of Virtual Items or Town Points between users may only be conducted via services approved of and provided by BlankMediaGames, if any, and BlankMediaGames may terminate any Account that acts in contravention of this prohibition.

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU SHALL HAVE NO OWNERSHIP OR OTHER PROPERTY INTEREST IN YOUR ACCOUNT, AND YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ALL RIGHTS IN AND TO THE ACCOUNT ARE AND SHALL FOREVER BE OWNED BY AND INURE TO THE BENEFIT OF BlankMediaGames.

XIV. EQUITABLE REMEDIES

You hereby acknowledge and agree that BlankMediaGames would suffer irreparable harm if this Agreement were not specifically enforced. Consequently, in addition to such monetary and other relief as may be recoverable at law, you agree that BlankMediaGames shall be entitled to specific performance or other injunctive relief, without bond, other security, or proof of damages, as remedy for any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. Additionally, in the event any legal or administrative action or proceeding is brought by either party in connection with this Agreement and consistent with Section XV below, the    prevailing party in such action or proceeding shall be entitled to recover from the other party all the costs, attorneys’ fees and other expenses incurred by such prevailing party as the result of the action or proceeding.
      
XV. NEGOTIATIONS, BINDING ARBITRATION AND GOVERNING LAW

A. <u>Negotiations.</u> Disputes can be expensive and time consuming for both parties. In an effort to accelerate resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute or claim related to this Agreement (“Claim”), you and BlankMediaGames agree to first attempt to informally negotiate any Claim for at least thirty (30) days (except those Claims expressly excluded in Section XV.F below). BlankMediaGames will send its notice to the address it has on file to the extent that you have provided additional contact information to BlankMediaGames (e.g. by participating in a promotion or survey, or contacting a customer services representative). Otherwise, BlankMediaGames will send its notice to the email address associated with your Account. You will send your notice to BlankMediaGames LLC, 9900 Spectrum Drive, Austin, TX 78717. Please note that this informal resolution procedure does not suspend any statutory limitation periods applicable to the bringing of a Claim.

B. <u>Binding Arbitration.</u> If the parties fail to resolve a Claim through negotiations, within such thirty (30)-day period, either you or BlankMediaGames may elect to have the Claim (except as otherwise provided in Section XV.F) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration by sending a written notice requesting arbitration to the other party. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. The arbitration will be conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA Rules”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”) that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated and under the terms set forth in this Agreement. Both the AAA Rules and the AAA Consumer Rules can be found at the AAA website, www.adr.org. In the event of a conflict between the terms set forth in this Section XV.B and either the AAA Rules or the AAA Consumer Rules, the terms in this Section XV.B will control and prevail.

Except as otherwise set forth in Section XV.F, you may seek any remedies available to you under federal, state or local laws in an arbitration action. As part of the arbitration, both you and BlankMediaGames will have the opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator’s decision regarding the Claim, the award given and the arbitrator’s findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator’s decision is based. The determination of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, (i) you and BlankMediaGames may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and (ii) the arbitrator’s decision is final, binding on all parties and enforceable in any court that has jurisdiction, provided that any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to follow applicable law.

BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND BlankMediaGames ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.

C. <u>Arbitration Fees.</u> If we are initiating arbitration for a Claim, we will pay all costs charged by the AAA Rules for initiating the arbitration. Your share of all other fees and costs of the arbitration, including your share of arbitrator compensation, will be charged pursuant to the AAA Rules, and where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. Where your share of the costs is deemed to be excessive by the arbitrator, BlankMediaGames will pay all arbitration fees and expenses.

D. <u>Location.</u> The arbitration will take place in your hometown area if you so notify BlankMediaGames in your notice of arbitration or within ten (10) days following receipt of BlankMediaGames’ arbitration notice. In the absence of a notice to conduct the arbitration in your hometown area, the arbitration will be conducted in Austin, Texas, unless the parties agree to video, phone and/or internet connection appearances. Any Claim not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction in Austin, Texas, United States of America, and you and BlankMediaGames agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

E. <u>Limitations.</u> You and BlankMediaGames agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Claim between BlankMediaGames and you individually. YOU AND BlankMediaGames AGREE THAT (A) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; (B) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; AND (C) NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER.

F. <u>Exceptions to Negotiations and Arbitration.</u> You and BlankMediaGames agree that the following Claims are not subject to the above provisions concerning negotiations and binding arbitration: (i) any Claims seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or BlankMediaGames’ intellectual property rights; (ii) any Claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (iii) any claim for equitable relief. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such courts’ jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration.

G. <u>Governing Law.</u> Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this Agreement shall be governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of the United States of America and the law of the State of Texas, without regard to conflict of law principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Other laws may apply if you choose to access the Game from outside of the United States. In such an event, those local laws shall affect this Agreement only to the extent necessary in that jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be interpreted to give maximum effect to the terms and conditions in this Agreement. You are responsible for compliance with all local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable. The New Zealand Consumer Guarantees Act of 1993 (the “Act”) may apply to the Game if you access the Game from, and are a resident of, New Zealand. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Act applies then you may have other rights or remedies as set out in the Act which may apply in addition to or instead of those set out in this Agreement.

H. <u>Severability.</u> You and BlankMediaGames agree that if any portion this Section XV is found illegal or unenforceable (except any portion of Section XV.F), that portion shall be severed and the remainder of the Section shall be given full force and effect. If Section XV.F is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor BlankMediaGames will elect to arbitrate any Claim falling within that portion of Section XV.F found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Claim shall be exclusively decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within Austin, State of Texas, United States of America, and you and BlankMediaGames agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.]]>
